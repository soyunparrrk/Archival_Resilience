# Research
## The History of Women in Coding

When one of the first computers in the human history were being operated during World War II, coding and programming were known as the work for people who possesses 'picky and precise' mentality. [#] Unlike the stereotypes of programmers in the current society, back then these people were assumed to be women. While it wasn't high-status work yet, the women were involved in mathematical calculations to execute instructions which we can define it as 'programming' in these current times. 

In 1960, the proportion of women in computing and mathematical professions was 27 percent in the United States. It reached the peak to 35 percent in 1990, but the numbers fell to 26 percent in 2013 which is below the percentage in 1960. Not only the number figures but also the culture and the societal view have been dramatically changed. Even now in 2020, programming is assumed to be 'men's job — as it needs precision, mathematical abilities, problem-solving skills which are not considered as women's major characteristics. 

### "Computing Girls"

Eddy Alleda, Dineke Botterweg, Ria Debets, Marijke de Jong, Bertha Haanappel, Emmy Hagenaar, Truus Hurts, Loes Kaarsenmaker, Corrie Langereis, Reina Mulder, Diny Postema and Trees Scheffer formed a group called the Computing Girls in the Netherlands. [#] As they had completed high school with high grades in mathematics, they were considered suitable for computation works.

They worked at the Mathematical centre programming early Dutch computers such as ARRA and ARRA II from 1954, guided by Van Wijngaarden who contracted them. Even though they were one of the pioneers of the present computer situation, due to their family forming and to devote to it they didn't use their knowledge in computer science anymore, except Eddy Alleda who worked as a math teacher later on. 

### Important Women Programmers and Their Forgotten History

Throughout the history, there are many legendary women mathematicians and programmers who highly contributed in development of technology. Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Evelyn Boyd Granville, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller, Radia Perlman are a few examples from them. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soyunparrrk/Archival_Resilience/master/The%20Computing%20Girls%20Today/grace_hopper.png">

Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist born in New York in 1906. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark 1 computer. She also popularised the idea of machine-independent programming languages such as COBOL, an early programming language we still use today.

A mathematician Ada Lovelace from England is known as the first coder in history. In 1833, she wrote an algorithm with which the Analytical engine, a design to execute if/then commands invented by Charles Babbage, would calculate the Bernoulli sequence of numbers. 

Even though women were the pioneers in programming for machines, the industry became much dominated by men over time. Not only the perspective for the characteristic of 'women' culturally didn't fit into computing anymore, but also women had less chances to be exposed to it for decades in normal households as 'programming' became a high-status job.

## Technical Research for Photography: its Digital Translation and Reproduction

Since the artefact is a little sheet of physical photograph, first I looked into the technical aspect of photography. 

**From the questions of the physical side:** How was the reality captured through an analogue camera? How does the image translate on a negative film during that process? How is that image printed on a light-sensitive photographic paper? 

**To digital:** What kind of technology has been used for scanning the piece of paper? How is it saved in a digital space? What kind of compression methods have been used? How do we see them in our eyes?

**And back to the physical world again:** What kind of methods are available for digital printing? What does it mean to re-print the original photograph? What kind of decisions are made during that process — The paper size? Which printing method (Inkjet? Laser? Gelatine Silver? Photogravure?...)? Colour or B&W(even though the original is B&W)? Fill or centre the image? What kind of paper?

# Transcoding

Description

## Transcoding 1: Lossless Compression

### Description

This photograph is not only capturing a historical memory but also cultural discourses around it. I was looking for a way to preserve this image with persistence. During the research about image compression methods, I've found turning images into a lossless format fascinating. 

### Methods

In image compression, there are several methods for lossless compression.

### Tools
I've used two existing tools for this, the first one is Image → Binary, the other one is Binary → Image.

### Results

1. **Image to Binary**<br>

2. **Binary to Image**

Several personal decisions had been made in this process.

1. Since the image is large I had to specify the customised resolution. 
2. 50% threshold was recommended as default.
3. Binary characters to display.


## Transcoding Tool: ARRA Today

### Description

Despite the effort of programmers and creators, unfortunately, the ARRA I couldn't operate for long. It only worked once in front of the mayor of Amsterdam producing a single, correct line of data. The women programmers continued to work for ARRA II, however, the majority of them got married which means they were expected to choose to devote their life to their family.

This process of ARRA's short life and death made me think of the ephemeral history of women in computation being left only as a short period for a long time until now.

Looking at the photograph of the huge machine that this programmer is checking an outcome from, I thought, what if, I build the ARRA again, as a female programmer myself. What if I program it to work as a revival of the historical moment — preserving the important visual form of the photograph, which depicts a woman next to a machine. 
<img src="">

### Aims

The ARRA contained 1200 relays connected at the back of the machine. Also, with drum memory it could execute the 16 coded instructions. It was able to represent binary numbers as decimal, using a paper punch tap reader and a teleprinter as input and output. 

For this transcoding, I aimed to recreate the ARRA  for today. It will enable image processing that users can insert their photos and make outputs by manipulating the images themselves. The way of image processing will reflect my whole research through this subject. By users re-creating their own images and videos digitally sorting pixels and pixels, I wish it continues to live for proliferation.

### Methods

I've programmed in a node-based software TouchDesigner using a visual language of wiring, connecting from commands to commands.<br>
<img src="The%2520Computing%2520Girls%2520Today/TD-example.jpg"><br>
As you see above, TouchDesigner requires wiring operators to make the software you program run. I find the visual representation of connecting parts to excecute the program is very similar to the physical parts being connected at the ARRA machine with wires and electrictity.

### Tools



### Results

The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here.

### Source Links

Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.

# Reflection

You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below.

# Outcomes

This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible.

### Outcome Links

Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored.

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).

# Conclusion

You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :)
